<h2>Pawn Abstract Machine (32-bit)</h2>
Starting with Pokémon X and Y in 2013, Game Freak ditched their proprietary scripting engine and opted for an (off-license) fork of CompuPhase's Pawn. The engine has been used without any further changes for all of the Nintendo 3DS Pokémon games. PokéScript's abstract instruction set is based upon Pawn's, guaranteeing full compatibility.

<br/>
SDKs for Pokémon X/Y and Pokémon Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire are available.
<br/>
<br/>
Pokémon Sun/Moon and Pokémon Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon are supported by PokéScript, but SDKs are not available.
